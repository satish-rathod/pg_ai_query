# PostgreSQL AI Query Extension

A powerful PostgreSQL extension that generates SQL queries from natural language using state-of-the-art AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.

## Features

- **Natural Language to SQL**: Convert plain English descriptions into valid PostgreSQL queries
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for both OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and Anthropic (Claude) models
- **Automatic Schema Discovery**: Analyzes your database schema to understand table structures and relationships
- **Intelligent Query Generation**: Creates optimized queries with appropriate JOINs, WHERE clauses, and LIMIT constraints
- **Query Performance Analysis**: Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on queries and get AI-powered performance insights and optimization suggestions
- **Configurable Response Formatting**: Choose between plain SQL, enhanced text with explanations, or structured JSON responses
- **Safety First**: Built-in protections against dangerous operations and unauthorized system table access
- **Flexible Configuration**: File-based configuration with support for API keys, model selection, and response formatting

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - PostgreSQL 12+ with development headers
   - CMake 3.16+
   - C++20 compatible compiler
   - API key from OpenAI or Anthropic

2. **Build and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/benodiwal/pg_ai_query.git
   cd pg_ai_query
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make && sudo make install
   ```

3. **Enable Extension**:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pg_ai_query;
   ```

### Configuration

Create `~/.pg_ai.config`:

```ini
[general]
log_level = "INFO"
enable_logging = false

[query]
enforce_limit = true
default_limit = 1000

[response]
show_explanation = true
show_warnings = true
show_suggested_visualization = false
use_formatted_response = false

[openai]
api_key = "your-openai-api-key-here"
default_model = "gpt-4o"

[anthropic]
api_key = "your-anthropic-api-key-here"
default_model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
default_model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure API keys using environment variables. These will override values in the configuration file:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: API key for Anthropic

Example:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

### Basic Usage

```sql
-- Generate simple queries
SELECT generate_query('show all customers');

-- Generate complex analytical queries
SELECT generate_query('monthly sales trend for the last year by category');

-- Generate queries with business logic
SELECT generate_query('customers who have not placed orders in the last 6 months');

-- Schema discovery functions
SELECT get_database_tables();
SELECT get_table_details('orders');

-- Explain and analyze query performance
SELECT explain_query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL ''7 days''');
SELECT explain_query('SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.id) FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id GROUP BY u.id');
```

### Response Formats

**Plain SQL (default)**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' LIMIT 1000;
```

**Enhanced with explanations and warnings**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' LIMIT 1000;

-- Explanation:
-- Retrieves all customers who were created within the last 7 days

-- Warnings:
-- 1. Large dataset: Consider adding specific filters for better performance
```

**JSON format** (set `use_formatted_response = true`):
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' LIMIT 1000;",
  "success": true,
  "explanation": "Retrieves all customers who were created within the last 7 days",
  "warnings": ["Large dataset: Consider adding specific filters for better performance"],
  "suggested_visualization": "table",
  "row_limit_applied": true
}
```

### Query Performance Analysis

The `explain_query` function runs EXPLAIN ANALYZE on your queries and provides AI-generated performance insights:

```sql
-- Analyze a simple query
SELECT explain_query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL ''7 days''');

-- Analyze complex queries with joins
SELECT explain_query('
    SELECT u.username, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
    FROM users u
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
    GROUP BY u.id, u.username
    ORDER BY order_count DESC
');

-- Use with specific API key and provider
SELECT explain_query(
    'SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100 ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 10',
    'your-api-key-here',
    'anthropic'
);
```

**Example Output:**
```
Query Overview:
This query retrieves all users created within the last 7 days, selecting key user information including ID, username, email, creation date, last login, and account status.

Performance Summary:
- Overall Execution Time: 0.043 milliseconds
- Total Cost: 12.10 (PostgreSQL's relative cost estimate)
- Rows Processed: 4 rows returned from 4 rows examined

Execution Plan Analysis:
- Limit Node: Restricts output to 1000 rows (though only 4 rows exist)
- Sequential Scan: Reads through the entire users table
- Filter Applied: created_at > (NOW() - '7 days'::interval)

Performance Issues:
No significant performance issues detected for this small dataset.

Optimization Suggestions:
- For larger datasets, consider adding an index on created_at column
- If this query runs frequently, a partial index on created_at WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days' could be beneficial

Index Recommendations:
CREATE INDEX idx_users_created_at ON users(created_at);
```
